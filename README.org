* What is this?

polysemy-pool is a small library implementing a resource pool effect to be used with polysemy.

* How do I use this?

Here's a short example:

#+BEGIN_SRC Haskell
foo = do
  res <- acquire
  bar res
  release res
#+END_SRC Haskell

Since a pool has usually a limited amount of resources, 'acquireMaybe' can be used to avoid stalling:

#+BEGIN_SRC Haskell
foo = do
  mres <- acquireMaybe
  case mres of
    Just res -> bar res >> release res
    Nothing -> embed (putStrLn "Ooops! We ran out of resources!")
#+END_SRC Haskell

The two examples above are useful, but are prone to bugs if your code isn't pure and may run into exceptions.
In this case, the right course of action would be to use 'withResourceIO' or 'withResourceFinalIO':

#+BEGIN_SRC Haskell
foo = withResourceIO $ \res ->
  embed $ putStrLn "Bzzz bzzzz"
  bar res
  embed $ putStrLn "All done!"
#+END_SRC Haskell

Or...

#+BEGIN_SRC Haskell
foo = withResourceFinalIO $ \res ->
  embedFinal $ putStrLn "Bzzz bzzzz"
  bar res
  embedFinal $ putStrLn "All done!"
#+END_SRC Haskell

These functions are implemented in terms of 'Resource' effect from Polysemy.
